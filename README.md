# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

Welcome to the Medical Insurance Cost Prediction project!

In this repository, I've independently developed a robust machine learning model that can predict medical insurance costs with remarkable accuracy. By leveraging a dataset containing crucial attributes such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region, and insurance charges, this project provides a tool that benefits both individuals and insurance providers.

## About the Project

In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, understanding and predicting medical insurance costs is more important than ever. Whether you're an individual looking to budget for your healthcare expenses or an insurance provider seeking to make informed pricing decisions, this project has you covered.

### Key Features

- **GradientBoostingRegressor**: I've harnessed the power of the GradientBoostingRegressor model, a cutting-edge machine learning algorithm, to provide precise cost predictions.

- **Clean Data**: The dataset is meticulously prepared, with no missing values, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

- **Comprehensive Visualization**: I've included insightful visualizations of both numerical and categorical columns, allowing you to explore the data and gain valuable insights.

- **Easy-to-Use**: I've made sure that the prediction tool is user-friendly, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced data enthusiasts.
